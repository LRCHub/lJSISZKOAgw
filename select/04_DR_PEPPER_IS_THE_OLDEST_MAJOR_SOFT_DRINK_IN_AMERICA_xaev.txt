Yeah
Eat whatever I want, my life is like a buffet
Just shake it off, I know you had a rough day
Yeah, this is a new sound, I call it an update
I fix it with C#, you're still using duct tape
Lit like a stoner, yeah, lit like a match stick
Yeah, fly like a rover, stretch like elastic
Target like I'm DOA, target like it's practice
Practice like the NBA, get it in the basket

I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
Hе say, "Nicki don't stop, you the bestest"
And I'd just bе coming off the top, asbestos

Okay boomer, I think you're a loser (Yeah)
I'm talking about a gun, not a real ruler
I feel like I'm Uzi Vert, this a Franck Muller
I feel like I'm Smokepurpp 'cause I got a boner

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night

Gettin' freaky on a friday night (Ahhhhh)
